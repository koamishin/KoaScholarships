## 🏗️ System Architecture & Workflow

The core of PhilexScholarV2 is the **Scholarship Application Lifecycle**. The system enforces a strict state machine to ensure data integrity:

1.  **Application Phase**: Student creates a profile -> Applies for a Program -> Submits Application.
2.  **Verification Phase**:
    *   Status: `documents_pending` -> `documents_under_review`.
    *   Admins review uploads. If rejected, status reverts for resubmission.
3.  **Approval Phase**:
    *   Status: `documents_approved` -> `eligibility_verified` -> `enrolled`.
    *   System checks if the student meets GPA/Unit criteria.
4.  **Maintenance Phase**:
    *   Status: `service_pending` -> `service_completed`.
    *   Students must submit Community Service Reports to qualify for funds.
5.  **Disbursement Phase**:
    *   Status: `disbursement_pending` -> `disbursement_processed` -> `completed`.

### Database Structure
Key entities include:
*   **Users & StudentProfiles**: Authentication and extended student details.
*   **ScholarshipPrograms**: Configuration of budgets, slots, and requirements.
*   **ScholarshipApplications**: The central pivot linking students to programs and tracking status.
*   **DocumentUploads & Requirements**: Handling file evidence.
*   **Disbursements**: Tracking financial transactions.
